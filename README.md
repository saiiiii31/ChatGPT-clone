# ChatGPT - clone

So I developed a clone version of it with an elegant user interface that resembles the ChatGPT app. It communicates with the advanced GPT3 model API, and most importantly, it has the ability to ask the AI for help regarding JavaScript, React, or any other programming language, giving it code and translating it to another programming language, and much more.
